Good traveller, pause, be cautious how you speak, 
'Twere better that you speak in whispers now, 
For this is Childwall, here the winding roads 
Where once the Demon Monk, whose thirst for blood 
Waylaid the tired and lonely traveller. 
Upon this spot the antient Abbey stood, 
And twenty lusty monks, Cistercian clad, 
Pursued their holy bent in pious works, 
When Richard Third was Sovereign Lord and King. 
Amidst the thickly-wooded oaks and elms 
Old Childwall stands, whilst seven miles away 
And to the West that city of a thousand 
Waterways sends out her ships to every 
Coast. For Liverpool has risen much beyond 
The Abbey village known a thousand years. 
The youthful Phoenix from the ashes fans 
Its wings and indicates the flight of time, 
And on its wings with speed we backwards fly 
Five hundred years to live again the past. 
The Abbot Anthony and his good monks 
With pallid fear upon their faces move 
In fear of unknown evil which abounds 
The Abbey and the three long-winding roads. 
Fly not away, take courage, tremble not, 
The Abbey's gate is opening and we see 
The stranger from afar pass through the gate 
Which opens wide to all who would find peace. 
Stay, stay, what terror this which strikes our hearts? 
It is the Demon Monk, whose evil soul 
Found peace at Chi'dwall and was purified 
By sacrifice of human blood and drained 
From out the veins of Father Anthony. 
Close not your eyes, miss nothing of the play, 
Shut not your ears, the words will teach you much. 
Go not your way until you are assured 
The Demon Monk Liveda he has passed. 
The curtain slowly rises, with us come, 
Read on the gates the words " Pax Vobiscum."

LivEda {weakly) : 
Open, in God's name, a Brother seeks rests. 
Francis (from within) : 
Content, content, I come, be of good heart, Childwall Abbey opens its gates to all. 
(Francis opens the gates and Livedo, who has been leaning against them, falls into his arms). 
LivEda (very weakly) : Food and rest. 
Francis : 
Holy Mother of God, he is well spent. Ho, there, Emmanuel, come hither, haste. (enter Emmanuel). 
Emmanuel : 
The Lord be with us, he is nigh to death. This pinched face and ghastliness of skin Doth tell of hunger which is long endured. 
Francis : 
Come, give assistance, the warmth of kitchen Will his frame give heat and there is wine To circulate his veins, restore t'life.

Abbot 
Fiveda : 
Rest for body truly but, not for mind, For there are chambers of the mind disturbed' Which conjure up strange phantoms of the past, AVhich whisper to my innermost soul and say, " Thou must partake of food more subtle than The food partaken by the normal man." 
Then the phantoms are right indeed, brother, For here within these walls a subtle food, And much abundant, can be found by all Who spend their time in right meditation. 
Abbot : 
John : 
Abbot : 
Aye, subtle food, good Abbot, such I seek. (exit). 
The saints forfend that he should find it not, For he is sore perplexed in his poor brain. Some weighty sorrow lurks within his depths And doth disturb his peace of mind and soul. (enter John). 
Good father, think you not this stranger monk Has manner strange enough to make one think He suffered from a mind that is diseased? 
May God forbid, but what gives thee such thought?

Abbot : 
'Tis but a moment since I saw him pass 
And he in seeing really saw me not. 
A ghastly smile was opening on his face 
And then his lips did move and spake these words : 
" Aye, subtle food and much there is to find 
Within these walls. How soon may come the feast?" What think'st thou underlies those words? 
Good brother John, methinks he needs great care For he is burdened by a sorrow which Doth weigh him down and gives his soul remorse. We all must fardels bear and with what strength Each one of us possess give them support. And if the Lord in His great wisdom sees They are too hard to bear, then in compassion Gives us greater strength and understanding To bear them, or removes them altogether. 
The Lord can do all things, in Him I trust, And yet within myself I have a fear Of something that forebodes evil intent. 
Come, John, thou art not prone to such musings. 
This Liveda is ill, and though so poor 
In, body, may be the richer in spirit. 
Let us render corporeal works of mercy 
As is our wont, then he, more strengthened in 
His mortal frame, may free his soul of that 
Which for the while gives him so much unquiet. 
Pray God that what thou say'st will come to pass, For he shall have my prayers at every Mass. (exit). 
John, good friend and brother, he has a noble Heart, but yet he sees not into souls of Men. This poor Liveda, seeking subtle Food, may have his fill for here are sacred Works which, when perused and meditated In the rightful mind, give nourishment to Hungry soul. His mien is strange, his speech but Scanty, but who shall call this fault, rather May it mark a depth of soul more used to Pious deeds and holy thoughts and surfaced Through mortifying flesh, contemplation. Here, in Childwall, let him seek and find what He desires, the lonely cell and cloisters With sunlight stealing through their apertures Shall give him hope and strength and brighter days.

The same. One week later. 
Discovered : The monks in conversation with the Abbot. 
Abbot : 
Good brothers, I implore that ye do speak Of such temptations that doth make ye break The discipline of silence. 
1st Brother : 
Good Abbot, we are truly sore perplexed And for this reason have we sought advice From thee, that thou in thy great wisdom can Dispel this strange affliction come o'er us To break the monotony of silence. 
Abbot : 
Monotony of silence? Come, expound. Do we not in the silence walk with God And hearken to His wisdom in our thoughts? Do not your exercises teach you this? How then can silence be monotonous? 
2nd Brother : 
We know not, father, what has brought this change In us; it is as though we were besailed By demons who would seek to swerve us from The path of righteousness. 
Abbot : 
'Tis very strange that ye are obsessed thus. What cause is there to make ye thus behave? Which one amongst ye by his spoken word Or sign or other implication has Caused any of his brethren to think thus That silence is monotonous? 
1st Brother : 
Not I, good father. 
2nd Brother : Nor I. 
Abbot (to other brethren) :

John : 
Good father, know'st thou the cause of this? How comes it that these pious gentle monks Who have for years in cause of sanctity Have listened to the holy word of God, Then in a moment, like unbridled fire, Are changed to unwise, unholy works Which mar the soul and cause them to recant Our sacred vows? 
"Tis very strange, and yet temptation came 
To our L,ord Jesus when He climbed the mount. 
But Jesus did not fall to temptation. 
True indeed, but can we compare ourselves To Jesus who was truly Son of God? 
Nay, nay, good father, yet are we not all Children of our Great and Mighty Father? 
Abbot : 
John : 
Abbot 
Verily, my son, but forget not this : While yet we have not found that higher self Which elevates us to that lofty plane Of spirit wherein we can with greater Wisdom see the evils which our mortal Flesh is heir to, temptations e'er will come. The soul, when fortified with pious works, Unfolded mind and love for all mankind, Can overcome the snares of evil one. 
Our brothers had the strength of mind to see Their erring ways, but yet their spirits weak Had not the power to combat temptation. And yet our discipline should give such strength To overcome the snares of evil one. 
'Yea, that is true, and yet T know not why The discipline should fail; but as it failed A stronger remedy has been prescribed To meet these ills.

"Tis true that penance is a mighty purge, And may it soon this evil wash away. But know there is one thing gives me unquiet And yet it may be vain imagining. 
Good John, if I can give thee peace in mind But tell me. What causes thy unquiet? 
Good father, give me chastisement if I In thought or word or deed another wrong. But hast thou not observed that every one Of our good brothers has sought thine advice Except Ljveda, lately come to us? 
Indeed, 'tis true, and I had not observed. 
Can we not think that he has not been snared? 
Pray God that he shall never be assailed 
By evils such as these; for even yet 
His body's strength is weak, not fit to fight 
Against temptations of the evil one. 
Yet he is undisturbed by anything Which doth affect our distressed brethren, And moves about with smile upon his face As though he found delight in what transpires. Would'st thou not think that he should feel remorse At suffering of his fellows? 
If he were in a normal state of health Indeed I should, but he is not, therefore We must forgive indifference found in him Towards his fellows' woes. 
Such have I thought and felt, but I cannot Shake off some strange presentiment which o'ercomes My normal peace and gives me cause to think And even fear that some great evil will O'ercloud our ancient Abbey and its monks. 
If it were that I knew thee not, good brother, 
I fain would think that thou wert either ill 
Or had some hatred for this stranger monk. 
Come, let thy mind find cheer in Holy Writ, 
A safeguard which keeps all from devilish pit. (exit).

John : 
Good Anthony, thou art a simple soul, Thy faith in erring man is most profound. Ah, could I generate such faith as thine To trust L,iveda, I would well find peace. There is great evil rising in our midst, But how and in what manner I know not. If mine own intuition I can trust, This stranger monk must be closely observed. For since he. came within this Abbey's walls A strange unholy fear has gripped my heart, And neither discipline nor penance has Left it unmoved, but rather heightened it. If he brings evil, let him then beware, For there is one in Childwall who will dare Forget he is a monk yet still a man And teach Liveda a lesson if he can.

Li veda : 
Take my advice and leave this dreaded place; 
If ye want freedom, claim it whilst ye may. 
Ye are but men, and pulsing through your veins 
Are strong desires to live and act like men. 
Then get ye hence into the thronged towns 
And there appease the_ curbed desires ye have 
In gaiety and pleasure, and forget 
These gloomy walls and cells. Matthew : 
How shall we pass through Abbey's oaken door 
When there are postulants who do observe 
All who shall come and go? Simon : 
Yea, true, and if we were to voice desire Unto the Abbot, he in righteous wrath Would punish us with extra penance and Confine us close to cells. Michael : 
The good Liveda gives us sound advice. Why should we waste our young and manly strength In these cold walls when there is life beyond? Liveda : 
And subtle food which fills the soul with fire More warming than the fare provided here. Come, waste not time but get ye hence this hour, Delays were ever dangerous, scale the wall. Matthew : 
The wall is some ten feet in height methinks, Therefore shall Simon scale it first, aided By myself and you, and then upon your shoulders Shall I mount and follow them.

And there are others too who shall in turn Supply me with my wants. L,iveda lives Whilst he can still retain this human form. I'll follow them and lure them into net Of my own weaving, and entangled thus I'll use them as I will. 
What gives to man his moods, desires, life, 
But running streams of crimson blood and in 
That selfsame blood are records of the past. 
When blood is fed by blood, the human frame 
Is spared the toil of churning all the dross 
From solid food. And as all men possess 
Within themselves the records of their race, 
Then he who feeds on blood participates 
In records from the one who yields his blood. 
The man who has within his veins mixed blood, 
Made up from many races of the past, 
Has all the traits which make for genius. 
The mongrel hound displays intelligence 
More marked than the pampered thoroughbred. 
And there are men who boast of purple blood 
With traits not far removed from the beasts. 
The blood is life and closely allied to 
The air of Macrocosm. As the air 
Is fraught with wonderful and mystic beings 
Like demons, angels, Elemental life, 
So does the tinctured red of blood contain 
The very life in temperament fourfold. 
The blood determines all our varied moods, 
As sanguine, melancholic, choleric or 
The phlegmatic, and makes us what we are. 
Liveda lives when he can drink of blood 
Fresh from the veins of sturdy living men, 
For they supply him with an added strength 
And help his form to longer walk the earth. 
Here then in Childwall subtle food I seek 
And to be found among the pious, meek, (exit).

Good father, we do share this fell burden Which mars thy peace and ladens deep sorrow Upon our house. Yet all these things have a cause. That cause we seek and in the seeking must Spare none, not e'en ourselves, until we have Brought evil-doers to boot.

And more still. By means of prayer and incense consecrate The cross-roads. Goest John with Henry here, Bring them back, cut them gently down, be not Observed by any village folk. 
Ah, could I bring them back with pulsing life

'Tis said his wife was poisoned and the blame Falls on his head. There is some truth in this For I hear from one of Stanley's serfs That Richard casts his eyes towards his niece, And as she will not to his amours list He threatened her with rape.

2nd Woman : 
Evil times indeed ! 'Twould almost seem the Wickedness of the King and his fell lords Has entered Holy Church. Who is there then Can stay the evil? 
1st Woman : 
The good God surely. For He is mighty And though of plenty he doth give us scope To mend our ways, if we will hearken not Unto His word then we do reap the much As we have sown for good or ill. But see, Here comes the Mistress Halsall. What's amiss? She is not wont to walk this time o' day. Good day to ye, Mistress Halsall. 
Mistress Halsall: 
Aye, it be good, for which the Lord be 
Praised. He gave us day with sunshine and hope, 
But with the night the terrors and despair. 
2nd Woman : 
What strange speech is this, good Mistress Halsall? And why art thou so early out of doors? 
Mistress Halsall: 
To make the most of day, for in the night 
There's terror here. I have seen the ghosts of 
The departed monks, neath silver moon fly 
Past, their ghostly heads lying on their shoulders limp 
And glassy eyes from sockets staring wild 
But seeing not. 
1st Woman : 
But where was this? 
Mistress Halsall : 
There by the three cross-roads where from the oaks Their bodies swung not many days ago.

Thou mean'st that they were hanged? 
Mistress Halsall : 
Aye, hanged, all of them. 
1 st Woman : 
Three holy fathers hanged (crosses herself) but by whose hand? 
2nd Woman : 
The Abbot surely would not dare. 
Mistress Halsall: 
Nay, God forbid, for he doth mourn their loss And I have heard that he hath sworn an oath To seek no rest until he fathoms out The evil cause. The monks are close confined Unto their cells, and liberties withheld Until he bids them sally forth again.

1 st Woman : 
Good Mistress Halsall, thou who seest much, Pray tell us, what has wrought this evil here? 
Mistress Halsall : 
A very beggar and a wretch indeed Who sought in Childwall holy sanctuary. He did break in upon the Abbey's peace For succour there, one perishing for want Whose hunger had not tasted food for days And humbly asked for . charity's dear sake For rest and food and drink ; and with him came The terror.

John, John, what is amiss? Thou art like death. What hast thou seen? Come, speak and with all haste. 
Good Father, I have seen a ghastly thing Which calls for holy vengeance from on high; The majesty and sacredness of death Have been despoiled. 
In God's name, speak, John. 
Our late Brothers, lying there in death who Were in peace enshrouded in cerements Of white, are all disturbed and from their sides Have been removed their hearts. O piteous sight ! 
Their hearts removed? 
Some fiend incarnate, bloody in his deeds, Doth here abide and works his evil will Not only on the living, foul enough, But desecrates the good departed that They find no peace in death. 
Who could dare to desecrate the dead and 
Bring upon himself the wrath of God? 
God's peace with us, no Monk would do such thing. 
And yet Fiveda smiles at slumbering dead, No sorrow's throb or tears of pity move His unperturbed heart. Good Father, heed Since this strange monk into our Abbey came Our peace is lost and shadows worse than night Have cast a pall upon us, sinister And we have witnessed things born not of God But fashioned from the depths of deadly hell. 
Good Brother, be guarded in thy speech, You have no proof in full which places guilt Upon Fiveda, yet shall, a watch be Kept upon this monk, and if 'tis proven He has hand in this, then unto civil power He must be passed and suffer punishment.

Et clamour meus ad te veniat.
